# Quickstart: Create a Go function in Azure using Visual Studio Code

In this tutorial, I am using Visual Studio Code to create a custom handler function that responds to HTTP requests.

After testing the code locally, I should deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions.

Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process.
